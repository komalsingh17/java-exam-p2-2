RotateList:  Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example, [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two (2) becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2].

I was trying to implement the rotation in the 'reverse direction' if a negative index is passed. The first approach was to write a whole another loop for that. But I am looking for a more concise code. I will work on it.
